# `{renv}`

This package uses [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to manage dependencies.

In order to ensure the development environment is properly tracked, please use the `dev=TRUE` option in `renv` functions. For instance, to check the status of your environment, use `renv::status(dev=TRUE)`. To log packages, use `renv::snapshot(dev=TRUE)`. (`renv::restore()` does not use this flag.)

Note that at project startup, `renv::status(dev=FALSE)` will execute first, reporting that the project is
out-of-sync. After, the project is set up to automatically run `renv::status(dev=TRUE)`, so consult this second output to check the true status of the project.
