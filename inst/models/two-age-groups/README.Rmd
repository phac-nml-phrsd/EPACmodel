### "two-age-group" model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with two age groups: young and old. The epidemiological compartments are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I$: infected
- $H$: hospitalized
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.

The force of infection for age group $i$, $\lambda_i$, which is the per-capita rate of flow of age $i$ susceptibles into the exposed class, is modelled as

$$
\lambda_i = \sum_{j} c_{ij} \beta_j \frac{I_j}{N_j}
$$

where 

- $c_{ij}$ is the contact rate of a susceptible in age group $i$ with an infected in age group $j$,
- $\beta_j$ is the transmission rate for age group $j$,
- $I_j$ is the number of infectious individuals in age group $j$,
- $N_j$ is the population size of age group $j$.

#### Available scenarios

- `transmission-intervention`: 
  - This scenario simulates two changes in the age-dependent transmission rates on specific days. 
  - Intervention days are specified through the `intervention.day` value. The default values yield changes on days 40 and 50.
  - Scalar multiples of the original transmission rates are specified via the `trans.factor.young` and `trans.factor.old` values, for the young and old, respectively. The default values reduce the transmission rate to 50% then 10% of the original value across both age groups.
