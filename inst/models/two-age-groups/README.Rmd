### `two-age-group` model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with two age groups: young and old. The epidemiological compartments are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I$: infected
- $H$: hospitalized
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.

#### Age-based transmission

The force of infection for age group $i$, $\lambda_i$, which is the per-capita rate of flow of age $i$ susceptibles into the exposed class (of the same age), is modelled as

$$
\lambda_i = \sum_{j} c_{ij} \beta_j I_j/N_j
$$

where 

- $c_{ij}$ is the contact rate of a susceptible in age group $i$ with an infected in age group $j$,
- $\beta_j$ is the transmission rate for age group $j$,
- $I_j$ is the number of infectious individuals in age group $j$,
- $N_j$ is the population size of age group $j$.

#### Input values

There are several input values for the base model. Some inputs are stratified by age group (with suffix `_y` for young and `_o` for old). We use the generic suffix `_j` to denote inputs for age group `j` in the list below:

- `state`: a named list of the initial state for the simulation, where the name of each state follows the pattern `[epi-state]_j`
- `params`: a named list of model parameters used to compute flow rates, including
  - `transmission_j`: transmission rate, denoted by $\beta_j$ in the force of infection above,
  - `c_ij`: contact rate, denoted by $c_{ij}$ in the force of infection above,
  - `progression_j`: rate of flow from exposed to infectious,
  - `recovery_j`: rate of flow from infectious to recovered,
  - `hospitalization_j`: rate of flow from infectious to hospitalized,
  - `discharge_j`: rate of from from hospitalized to recovered,
  - `deathH_j`: rate of flow from hospitalized to dead,
  - `deathI_j`: rate of flow from infectious to dead.

Optional (scenario-specific) input values are documented in the [next section](#available-scenarios-tagm).

#### Available scenarios {#available-scenarios-tagm}

##### `change-transmission` scenario

This scenario simulates two changes in the age-dependent transmission rates on specific days. 

Intervention days are specified through the `intervention.day` input value. The default values yield changes on days 40 and 50.

Scalar multiples of the original transmission rates are specified via the `trans.factor.young` and `trans.factor.old` input values, for the young and old, respectively. The default values reduce the transmission rate to 50% then 10% of the original value across both age groups.
