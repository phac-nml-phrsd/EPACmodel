### `hosp` model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with five-year age groups up to age 80. The epidemiological compartments are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I_x$: infected, with fate $x$, where $x$ is either:
    - $R$, recovered without hospitalization,
    - $H$, hospitalized, or 
    - $D$, dead
- $A_y$: hospitalized in acute care, with fate $y$, where $y$ is either:
    - $R$, recovered after acute care only
    - $CR$, critical care with a prognosis of recovery
    - $CD$, critical care with a prognosis of death
    - $D$, death after acute care only
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.

#### Age-based transmission

The force of infection for age group $i$, $\lambda_i$, which is the per-capita rate of flow of age $i$ susceptibles into the exposed class (of the same age), is modelled as

The force of infection for  occurs in an age-based way, as a proxy for population heterogeneity. The transmission rate for susceptibles of age `i` and infectious individuals of age `j` is calculated as

$$
\lambda_i = \tau \sum_{j} p_{ij} \hat{c}_j I_j/N_j 
$$

where

- $\tau$ is the transmissibility of the pathogen, quantified as the proportion of contacts between a susceptible and an infectious individual that yield transmission (independent of age),
- $p_{ij}$ is the proportion of age group $i$'s contacts that occur with age group $j$,
- $\hat{c}_j$ is the average contact rate for individuals in age group $j$ (across all ages),
- $I_j$ is the number of infectious individuals in age group $j$ (at a given time)---totalled across infectious subcategories $I_R$, $I_A$, $I_D$,
- $N_j$ is the population size of age group $j$.

The average contact rate vector ($\hat{c}$) and the contact proportion matrix ($\left[p_{ij}\right]$) are both generated using a weighted average of four setting-based component contact matrices, derived by [Mistry et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20544-y), which reflect contacts in households, workplaces, schools, and community (all other contacts outside of the three previous settings). The weights are the average overall contact rate per setting. This weighted average generates an overall contact matrix. The row sums of this matrix give the average contact rate vector, $\left[\hat{c}_j\right]$, and the row-normalized version of this matrix is the contact proportion matrix ($\left[p_{ij}\right]$).

Optional (scenario-specific) input values are documented in the [next section](#available-scenarios-fyagm).

#### Available scenarios {#available-scenarios-fyagm}

##### `change-contacts` scenario 

This scenario enables the simulation of an intervention that affects the age-based contact patterns starting on a specified day from the start of the simulation (the "intervention day").

The intervention day is specified with the `intervention.day` input value. The default value simulates a stay-at-home order starting on day 25. 

An intervention involves using a new contact matrix starting on the intervention day, which is generated with new setting weights, specified in the `setting.weight.new` input value. The default values reflect closing all schools, 50% of workplaces, and reducing community contacts by 75% from the default `setting.weight` input value (see above).

The user can also change overall transmissibility of the pathogen starting on the intervention day to some scalar multiple of the original value via the `trans.factor` input value. The default values include `trans.factor = 1`, so no change to underlying transmissibility.
