### "five-year-age-group" model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with five-year age groups up to age 80. The epidemiological compartments are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I$: infected
- $H$: hospitalized
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.

Contact matrices are from Mistry et al.

(TODO: discuss contact matrices further)
