### "five-year-age-group" model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with five-year age groups up to age 80. 

The lower bound of each age group is captured in the `age.group.lower` value. This age-structure is currently hard-coded into the model definition, though future versions of the model will flexibly generate age groupings on request (once product models are fully implemented in [`macpan2`](https://github.com/canmod/macpan2)). 

The epidemiological compartments of this model are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I$: infected
- $H$: hospitalized
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.

#### Age-based transmission

Transmission occurs in an age-based way, as a proxy for population heterogeneity. The transmission rate for susceptibles of age `i` and infectious individuals of age `j` is calculated as

$$
\tau \cdot \hat{c}_i \cdot p_{ij}
$$

where

- $\tau$ is the transmissibility of the pathogen, as quantified as the proportion of contacts between a susceptible and an infectious individual that yield transmission (independent of age)
- $\hat{c}_i$ is the average contact rate for individuals of age $i$ (with all ages)
- $p_{ij}$ is the proportion of age group $i$'s contacts that occur with age group $j$

The average contact rate vector ($\hat{c}$) and the contact proportion matrix ($\[p_{ij}\]$) are both generated using a weighted average of four setting-based component contact matrices, derived by [Mistry et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20544-y), which reflect contacts in households, workplaces, schools, and community (all other contacts outside of the three previous settings). A vector of weights, indicating the average overall contact rate per setting is specified by the `setting.weight` value. The weighted average generates an overall contact matrix. The row sums of this matrix give the average contact rate vector, $\hat{c}$, and the row-normalized version of this matrix is the contact proportion matrix ($\[p_{ij}\]$).

The transmissibility of the disease is specified with the `transmissibility` value.

#### Available scenarios

- `"contact-intervention"`:
  - This scenario enables the simulation of an intervention that affects the age-based contact patterns starting on a specified day from the start of the simulation ("intervention day"). 
  - The intervention day is specified in the `intervention.day` value. The default value simulates a stay-at-home order starting on day 25. 
  - In intervention involves using a new contact matrix starting on the intervention day, which is generated with new setting weights, specified in the `setting.weight.new` value. The default values reflect closing all schools, 50% of workplaces, and reducing community contacts by 75% from the default values for the `setting.weight`s.
  - The user can also change overall transmissibility of the pathogen starting on the intervention day to some scalar multiple of the original value via the `trans.factor` value. The default values include `trans.factor = 1`, so no change to underlying transmissibility.
