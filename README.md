# EPACmodel

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package implements the Early Pandemic Age-Structured Compartmental
(EPAC) model developed by [Michael WZ Li](https://github.com/wzmli) and
[Irena Papst](https://github.com/papsti) from the [Public Health Risk
Sciences Division](https://github.com/phac-nml-phrsd) of the Public
Health Agency of Canada using
[`macpan2`](https://github.com/canmod/macpan2) modelling software.

The goal of this package is to catalogue, document, and version
iterations of the Early Pandemic Age-structured Compartmental model so
that they can be pulled easily into project-specific pipelines to
produce modelling outputs.
